A minimalist full-stack expense tracker that skips the database and uses a good old-fashioned .txt file for persistence — because why not?

This project is a fully functioning CRUD application built with vanilla JavaScript, Express.js, and pure vibes. It demonstrates the core concepts of client-server communication, routing, data manipulation, and persistence — all without using a traditional database.
